In order to get started, clone this repo, install Python and Django.

Runs from atracker_backend/ folder. In the console, the start command is:
"python manage.py runserver"

The app is currently hosted on localhost:8000, and responds to requests at:
/wellness/{exercise type}/{exercise id}

Pending live data and returning JSON. This is not meant to hold the views, the frontend will be in a different repo.
